AI-Powered Job Recommendation & Career Insights Dashboard
 Project Overview

This project develops an AI-powered system that helps job seekers by:

Providing personalized job recommendations based on resume-to-job semantic matching.

Delivering an interactive dashboard with real-time labor market insights, including in-demand skills, salary benchmarks, and career trajectories.

Unlike traditional job portals (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed) that rely heavily on keyword matching, our system integrates NLP, ML, and forecasting to provide contextual, personalized, and future-oriented recommendations.
